# Task:

Look in MY repository: https://github.com/jakob-hede/lliva_sume

I want to structure the data for 3 albums from the Greenlandic rock band Sume. 
The data is in the file:
`https://github.com/jakob-hede/lliva_sume/blob/main/data/sume_albums.md`. 

There is a template for the yaml format in the file:
`https://github.com/jakob-hede/lliva_sume/blob/main/data/albums.template.yml`.

I want you to parse the data from the markdown file and structure it in the yaml format.
Each track has a greenlandic and a danish title.
The danish titles need some spell correction.
Just use the greenlandic titles as is.

Remember to encode special chars properly for yaml!!!
Which means you MUST encode such chars as the danish chars: "æ", "ø", "å" and the greenlandic chars: "ĸ", "ĩ", "û", "â etc!!!

Do NOT change the yaml-format!
Do NOT invent imaginary data!!!

Do you need more information?

# Task:

Look in MY repository: https://github.com/jakob-hede/lliva_sume

I want to structure the data for 3 albums from the Greenlandic rock band Sume. The data is in the file `https://github.com/jakob-hede/lliva_sume/blob/main/data/sume_albums.md`. 

There is a template for the yaml format in the file `https://github.com/jakob-hede/lliva_sume/blob/main/data/albums.yml`.

I want you to interpret the data from the markdown file and structure it in the yaml format.
Each track has a greenlandic and a danish title.
The danish titles need some spell correction.
Just use the greenlandic titles as is.

Remember to encode special chars properly for yaml.

Do you need more information?

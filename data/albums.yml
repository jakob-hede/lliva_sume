      "Greenlandic rock band founded in 1972 by Malik H\xF8egh and Per Berthelsen (both\
        \ vocals and guitar) in Sor\xF8, Denmark, where the founding members studied. Their\
        \ 1973 debut Sumut was the first rock album in the Greenlandic language and breaking\
        \ the waves for Greenlandic political rock. In 1977 they released the first album\
        \ by the first Greenlandic label Ulo - and disbanded the same year. Since then the\
        \ band has frequently rejoined to perform and in 1994 they released a new album,\
        \ Persersume, the 100th album release on Ulo. October 2014 saw the release of a\
        \ documentary retracing the history of the band: \"Sume - lyden af en revolution\"\
